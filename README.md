# Linux-Shell-Scripting
Linux shell scripting is the process of writing scripts or programmes that use a Linux-based operating system's command-line interface (CLI) to automate processes, conduct system actions, and modify data. The shell is a command interpreter that allows users to communicate with the operating system and run commands.
